# The tweet-analysis project

## What it is

While doing the **python+postgres training from packt** it became clear that the **example programs are outdated** by now:
- the **psycopg2** module could not be installed under windows any more, so an upgrade to psycopg3 was indicated
- the **twitter** example is clearly outdated because 'twitter' has become 'x' by now, with a much different (oauth) API 

The code in this repository, when ready, will have code that is perfectly working in 2024 ..
